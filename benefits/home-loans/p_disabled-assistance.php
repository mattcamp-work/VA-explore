  Adapted Home Benefits
</p>
<p>
    Veterans with certain service-connected disabilities may apply for grants to build an adapted home or install ramps, widen doors, or make other
    modifications to live more independently.
</p>
<p>
    All grants have maximum amounts set by Congress and are indexed to construction costs. VA administers three grants that accommodate Veterans’ unique
    housing needs:

    Adapted Vehicle Benefits
</p>

<p>
    Under certain circumstances, Veterans may be eligible for financial assistance to purchase adaptive vehicle equipment. These benefits are paid to you or to
    the vehicle seller directly. Along with special equipment to assist in getting into and out of vehicles, adaptive equipment may include power steering,
    brakes, windows, and seats. To apply, complete <a href="http://www.va.gov/vaforms/medical/pdf/10-1394-fill.pdf">VA Form 10-1394</a> (Application for
Adaptive Equipment – Motor Vehicle) and submit it to    <a href="http://www2.va.gov/directory/guide/division_flsh.asp?dnum=1">your nearest VA medical center</a>.
