                         <h3>VA Memorial Benefits</h3>

                        <p>
                            VA takes special care to pay lasting tribute to the memory of Veterans who served and sacrificed and that of their families. VA meticulously maintains 131 VA national cemeteries in 39 states and is consistently adding new sites to accommodate Veterans and loved ones in their time of need. In a few years, 95 percent of Veterans will have a burial option located within about an hourâ€™s drive of their home.
                        </p>
                       
                        
                        
                       <p>
                            Veterans who have served honorably are automatically entitled to VA burial services. Spouses and dependent children may be eligible, too. 
                       </p>

                       <p>
                        Benefits may include burial in a VA national cemetery, including the opening and closing of the gravesite, perpetual care, inscribed headstones or markers, a burial flag, and a Presidential Memorial Certificate. Eligible Veterans and family members may receive headstones, markers, or medallions to place in private cemeteries worldwide. Some Veterans may also be eligible for burial or cremation allowances or use benefits for private cemetery burials that also include a headstone or marker, a burial flag, and a Presidential Memorial Certificate. Eligible Veterans may choose to be cremated and ask for their remains to be buried or inurned in national cemeteries in the same manner and with the same honors as casketed remains.
                       </p>
                        <p>
                            Please note that VA gravesites cannot be reserved in advance.
                        </p>

                                It takes about 10 minutes to establish eligibility for burial in a VA national cemetery.
                            </p>

At the time of need, families simply fax the DD-214 form or other discharge papers to 1-866-900-6417 and follow up with a phone call to 1-800-535-1117.
