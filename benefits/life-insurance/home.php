                                    With <strong>VGLI,</strong> Veterans leaving service have the option to convert full-time SGLI coverage to lifetime renewable term insurance. No health
                                    questions will be asked of Veterans who apply for coverage within 240 days of separation. However, Veterans have a total of one year and 120 days to apply
                                    for VGLI, and coverage will remain as long as premiums are paid.
                                </p>

                                    Spouses of Veterans separating from the military and covered under <strong>FSGLI</strong> can convert their coverage to an individual policy with
                                    participating private insurers. Spouses must act within 120 days of the Veteran’s separation to get this benefit.
                                </p>

                                    Under the<strong> SGLI Disability Extension,</strong> Veterans separating from service who are considered totally disabled and unable to work may apply
                                    for two years of free coverage through this provision. After two years, Veterans will automatically qualify for VGLI, as long as the premiums are paid.
                                </p>

                                    With<strong> Veterans’ Mortgage Life Insurance,</strong> Veterans considered severely disabled may be able to get mortgage life insurance protection,
                                    which pays the family’s home mortgage in the event of a Veteran’s death.
                                </p>

                        Many Veterans also do not realize that VA does not require a 100 percent disability rating to qualify for<strong>Service-Disabled Veterans Insurance.</strong> Even Veterans with no disability rating may qualify if they meet other criteria. And    <strong>Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance Traumatic Injury Protection</strong> covers Veterans and Servicemembers injured anywhere, anytime.
