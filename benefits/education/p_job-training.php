                    <h3>Veteran's Job Training</h3>

                    <p>
    VA benefits provide <a href="http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/onthejob_apprenticeship.asp">on-the-job training and apprenticeship</a> support through
programs that typically involve a training contract with an employer or union for a specific period of time. Use VAâ€™s    <a href="http://inquiry.vba.va.gov/weamspub/buildSearchInstitutionCriteria.do">search tool</a> to locate training or apprenticeships in your state.
</p>
<p>
    Most Veterans receive a salary from the employer or union during training. As your skills increase, so may your salary. At the end of the VA-supported
    training period, Veterans receive a job certification or journeyman status.
